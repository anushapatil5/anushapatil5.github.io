subtitle: Glimpse into Anusha's life

My name is Anusha Patil. I came to New York in 2019 to pursue a Masters degree in Data Science at NYU Center for Data Science. 
I have a strong background in Electronics and Communication Engineering and keen interest in Computer Science principles and this multi-disciplinary education has led me to this career path. 


### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
