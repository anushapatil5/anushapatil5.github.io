subtitle: Glimpse into Anusha's life
---

Hello, my name is Anusha Patil. I came to New York in 2019 to pursue a Masters degree in Data Science at NYU Center for Data Science. 
I have a strong background in Electronics and Communication Engineering and keen interest in Computer Science principles and this multi-disciplinary education has led me on this career path.

I'm an avid reader (or used to be), love watching films, passionate about music, and love to cook (Just like most people now). I am very passionate about the cosmos and have an imaginative mind.  

Hope you've enjoyed my blog!
