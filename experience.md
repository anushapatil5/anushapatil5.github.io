## Experience
+ **Graduate Research Assistant (NLP)**: Working on automating the data mining process for a text-as-data processing task by developing a tool to automatically select the most informative observations, building more accurate classifiers at lower cost. In most text-as-data applications, the first step involves collecting a corpus and randomly selecting some observations to hand-label. I am working on representing documents in a low-dimensional space, then identifying the documents that best span that space, ensuring that each hand-labeled document adds as much information as possible to the predictive model. I am currently working with Aaron Kaufman who is an Assistant Professor at NYU.


+ **Data Science Summer Incubator Program**: Working on non-invertible, privacy preserving representation learning for audio using OpenL3. The entire pipeline includes extracting features from audio (its melspectrogram) by using OpenL3 and building an inversion model which uses the embeddings obtained from the OpenL3 model to reconstruct the original audio (its melspectrogram). We are working on limiting the reconstruction of audio from its features by adding counter measures such as noise injection, quantization etc. so as to preserve privacy. The aim is for this reconstructed audio to have enough features to be usable for a downstream task but keeping the privacy of its content preserved. Mentor: Brian McFee, Assistant Professor at NYU.


+ **Verzeo**: Worked on deploying a Q&A system in EdTech. Used cosine similarity between sentences to find answers to questions from Verzeo's online course database. Responsible for database management using MySQL Workbench.

+ **42hertz INC (acquired by Cisco)** Worked on implementing a CLV prediction model using Pareto/NBD model and the Lifetimes library in Python. [See post here](https://anushapatil5.github.io/2020-07-09-cltv/). Also was part of the end-to-end implementation from designing the architecture, testing all the way up to the deployment of a recommender system for Shopify, the E-commerce solutions platform. The recommender system is an app that can be found in the Shopify App Store. [Click here to see the app](https://apps.shopify.com/kraken?surface_detail=kraken+recommends&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=4&surface_type=search). I worked closely with [Jagadeesh Dyaberi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagadeesh-dyaberi-4a87951/), the VP of Engineering and Delivery at 42hertz INC.

+ **Indian Institute of Astrophysics** Responsible for analysis of emission lines in the spectral data of a classical nova obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope using [Image Reduction and Analysis Facility](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf). I wrote a paper at the end of the internship that summarizes my analysis and findings. [Click here to see the paper](https://github.com/anushapatil5/SpectralAnalysis). Selected by Indian Academy of Science's Summer Research Fellowship Program and was among 194 selected candidates across India. Selected by [Dr. G.C. Anupama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._C._Anupama), Dean of Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the first woman to serve as President of the Astronomical Society of India.
